# Underwater Expedition, No Snorkel Required

Jun 19, 2018

In celebration of their new planetarium show, [Expedition
Reef](https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/expedition-reef), the
California Academy of Sciences released 5 Lenses that explore complex
coral reef ecosystems around the world. The realistic and
scientifically-accurate Lenses were created by the Academy’s in-hour
Visualization Studio and is a great examples of how scientific
institutions can use Lens Studio. We’re so excited to see more
educational Lenses that entertain from CAS and others\!

Happy creating,

Team Lens Studio
