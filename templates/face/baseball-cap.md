# Baseball Cap

The Baseball Cap Template lets users create a customizable baseball cap.
This template is a great starting point to easily feature your own 2D
artwork in a Face Lens. The template comes with a configurable 3D
baseball cap which you can recolor and decorate with any image you like.
It also features Face Mask Effects you can recolor and replace. This
guide covers how to customize the baseball cap and face paint effects,
as well as how to import your own custom logo and face paint patterns.
