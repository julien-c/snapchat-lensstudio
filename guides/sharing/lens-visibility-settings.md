# Lens Visibility Settings

This guide explains how to adjust the visibility setting for your Lens. 

## Do not promote 

By default, all live Lenses are public. This means Snapchatters around
the world can find and use your amazing creations when they have the
Lens's Snapcode, or if they find your Lens in Snapchat, for example in
Lens Explorer or in search, or in Snap Camera. 

If for any reason you wish to prevent Snapchatters from finding your
Lens in Snapchat or Snap Camera, you may set the visibility setting of
your Lens to `Do not promote`.

### Configuring Visibility Settings in My Lenses

Any Lens can be set to `Do not promote`. To change the setting on a Lens
that you do not want to be found in Snapchat or Snap Camera, follow
these steps:

1.  Find the Lens in My Lenses 
2.  Tap on the ••• menu (three dots) 
3.  Toggle `Do not promote` to `on`
4.  Click `Okay` to confirm

That's it\! This Lens will no longer be discoverable in Snapchat or Snap
Camera. Please allow a few minutes for these changes to take place. 

**Tip**  
Though your Lens is no longer discoverable in Snapchat or Snap Camera,
the Lens is still live. Anyone with the Snapcode or Lens link will be
able to use your Lens and share it with others. To prevent anyone from
using your Lens you must deactivate it.
