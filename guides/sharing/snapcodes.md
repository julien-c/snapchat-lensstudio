# Snapcodes

## Introduction

A Snapcode is a unique code you can scan to access features or unique
content on Snapchat. Each Lens created in Lens Studio generates its own
Snapcode that can be unlocked by people everywhere.  

## Sharing Your Snapcode

### Distributing Snapcodes

Once your Snapcode is live, feel free to share your Snapcode online, on
social media, and in print, but make sure to follow the guidelines below
before doing so.

**Do...**

  - Test your SnapcodeÂ before posting it
  - Add text that invites others to scan the Snapcode to unlock your
    Lens
  - Place your Snapcode on product packaging. Always test your Snapcode
    on packaging before it goes into mass production

**Do Not...**

  - Modify your Snapcode, unless you are resubmitting the Lens to
    Snapchat for approval
  - Sell merchandise (such as stickers, apparel, etc.) that feature
    Snapcodes. You cannot use our brand assets in this way without
    permission from Team Snapchat

### Distributing Lens Links

Lens Links allow you to share your Lens without providing a Snapcode. If
someone that has Snapchat taps the link, they will be sent directly to
your Lens in the app. If they are on a desktop computer or do not have
Snapchat, they will be directed to a web page that features the
Snapcode.

Feel free to share your Lens Links online, on social media, and within
Snaps as a URL attachment.
