Service](https://www.snap.com/terms/), [Community
Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/guidelines) and the [Lens
Studio Terms](https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms/lens-studio-terms/), and
must follow all Snap policies governing the use of our products or

Policy](https://www.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy/) to learn how we

## Content Requirements

  - Lenses are a playful and fun experience. Be creative and visually
    compelling. Make something that Snapchatters will want to send to
    their friends. We strive to ensure a positive and inclusive
    experience for Snapchatters around the world and will remove any
    Lens that we believe is in violation of this spirit.
  - Do not include content that:
      - Uses or is suggestive of Snap’s trademarks or products. This
        includes references to our properties or products, including
        “Snap,” “Snapchat,” “Spectacles,” the Ghost Logo, the
        Spectacles Logo, the Snapchat user interface, and Snapcodes
        (except when using the Marker with Snapcode template).
      - Suggests any partnership with or endorsement by Snap.
      - Depicts or promotes regulated products or content from regulated
        industries.
      - May incite or glorify violence or the use of weapons.
      - Includes obscene language or imagery, depictions of nudity, sex
        acts, or profanity.
      - May be considered offensive by a particular group of
        individuals, or that could foster negative stereotypes, such as
        slurs or other derogatory language.
      - Promotes dangerous, harmful, or illegal activity, or that
        encourages Snapping while driving.
      - Contains hashtags or usernames.
      - Threatens to harm a person, group of people, or property. We
        don’t tolerate bullying, threats, or harassment on Snapchat.

## Intellectual Property Rights

  - You must obtain all necessary rights and permissions for the content
    you submit as part of a Lens. This includes obtaining all necessary
    performance rights for music included in Lenses, and paying all
    applicable royalties for the music.
  - Rightsholders and their agents can report alleged intellectual
    property infringement found in Lenses to Snap. Snap takes all
    complaints regarding intellectual property infringement seriously
    and will investigate them. Takedowns are processed at Snap’s
    discretion. We make no guarantees as to the outcome of our
    investigations or the legitimacy of the complaints we receive. To
    report copyright infringement on Snapchat, follow the instructions
    at this [link](https://support.snapchat.com/co/report-copyright).
  - Please keep in mind that in making your Lens available to
    Snapchatters, Snap may display your name, business name (if
    applicable), Lens name, Snapchat account username or display name,
    city, state, and country, as submitted by you or tied to your
    Snapchat account.

## Technical Requirements

  - Frame Rate: For iPhone 6 and higher, the Lens should run at 27 FPS
    or higher. For Android Galaxy S6 and higher, the Lens should run at
    15 FPS or higher.
  - Memory: In Snapchat, the Lens should consume a maximum of 120 MB RAM
    memory.
  - Exported Lens Size: Once exported, the zipped Lens should be no more
    than 4 MB and optimally less than 2 MB for quicker Lens download.
  - Texture Size: No texture should exceed 2048x2048 resolution. No mesh
    should exceed 65,536 triangles.
