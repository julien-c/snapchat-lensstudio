# Image Picker Texture

The Image Picker Texture resource allows you to get an image from your
device's camera roll and use it as a texture. 

As long as the Image Picker texture is being used in the scene, Snapchat
will automatically show an interface allowing the user to pick from
their camera roll. If you want a texture from the device's camera roll
centered on a face, refer to the [Face Image Picker
Texture](/guides/face/face-effects/face-image-picker-texture) guide. 

## Create the Image Picker Texture

To create an Image Picker Texture resource, select `Add New -> From
Image Picker` in the `Resources` panel.

This will create a texture that you can now utilize like any other
texture resource. It can be applied to a material texture field, added
to an [Image or Screen Image](/guides/2d/image) and more. As long as it
is being utilized by the Lens, the UI to select from the device's camera
roll will automatically appear to the user. 

**Warning**  
Lens Studio only supports using either a [Face Image Picker
Texture](/guides/face/face-effects/face-image-picker-texture) OR
an [Image Picker Texture](/guides/2d/image-picker-texture) in your
project. You can't use both. When trying to add both in
the `Resources` panel, Lens Studio will show an error and prevent you
from adding.

## Preview Image Picker

When an Image Picker Texture is used in your Lens, a UI will
automatically appear in Snapchat allowing you to select from photos in
your device's camera roll. You can preview this functionality within
Lens Studio by enabling the `Show Snapchat UI` button in the bottom left
corner of the `Preview` panel. When enabled, you'll see the same image
picker interface used in Snapchat pre-filled with example photos.
