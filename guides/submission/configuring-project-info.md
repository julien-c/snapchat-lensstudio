# Configuring Project Info

The `Project Info` settings window is where additional info, required
for Lens submission, is configured. To access the `Project Info`
settings window, click the `Project Info` button in Lens Studio's
toolbar.

![Project
Info](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/project_info_toolbar.png)

You should make sure the Lens project info is configured properly before
submitting the Lens. Below are the various settings that are
configurable through the `Project Info` settings window.

The icon for the Lens is packaged with the Lens here. Click the `Choose
Icons` button and select an icon image. You can use the icon cropper to
choose the region of your icon.

If your icon has a transparent background, you can enable the
`Background` option and select a background color.

Icon](/guides/submission/creating-an-icon) guide.

A Lens Preview is also packaged with your Lens. A preview shows off your
Lens in Lens Explorer and will be visible to the public. Click on `Add
Lens Preview` to pick a pre-made video or upload your own. For more
information on Preview Videos, please refer to the [Preview
Videos](/guides/submission/creating-a-preview-video) guide.

## Size

![Project

The size of the compressed Lens that will be uploaded upon submission.
The size limit for a submitted Lens is `4 mb` but we advise staying
at `2 mb` or less for a quicker download. For more information, refer
to the [Performance and
Optimization](/guides/submission/performance-and-optimization) guide.
For information on optimizing 2D images, see the [2D
Optimization](/guides/2d/2d-optimization) guide.

## Lens Works On

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/lens_work_on.png)

The `Lens Works On` drop down allows you to set which camera needs to be
open in Snapchat for the user to see the Lens in your carousel. Here you
can set if you want your lens to appear on the Front Camera (for Face
Lenses), Rear Camera (for World Lenses) or Both Cameras (for Face and
World experiences). 

**Note**  
When you unlock a lens, the camera will switch automatically to the
selected camera and default to Face if Both Cameras is selected.

## Hint

![Project

The hint is a suggestion given to the user to help instruct interaction.
The hint appears as soon as the Lens is turned on and fades out after a
set number of seconds. For more information, refer to the [Lens
Hints](/guides/submission/lens-hints) guide.
