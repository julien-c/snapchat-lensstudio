# Materials

![Basic
Material](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_guide.png)

## Introduction

This guide provides instruction on the process of creating and editing
basic materials for 3D objects in Lens Studio, as well as an overview of
the default material types available in Lens Studio.

## Adding a Material

There are three ways to add a Material to a Lens Studio project:

  - Creating a new Material
  - Importing a Material from a 3D FBX file
  - Importing a Material from an existing Lens Studio project

The following sections cover each of these methods.

### Creating a New Material

You can create a new material from scratch in the `Resources` panel.

First, in the `Resources` panel, click `Add New`.

Select `Material`, then select a material type (for example, "Diffuse").

![Add New
Material](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/resources_add_new_material.gif)

### Importing a Material from an FBX File

When you import a 3D Object (FBX) into your project, any materials
included in the FBX definition will be automatically imported as well.

Once your FBX is imported, you should see the Material in your
`Resources` panel.

**Tip**  
For more information on importing and exporting 3D objects, visit
the [3D Object Import](/guides/3d/3d-object-import) and [3D Object
Export](/guides/3d/3d-object-export) guide.

Once your FBX is imported, you should see the Material in your
`Resources` panel.

### Importing a Material from an Existing Project

In the `Resources` panel, select `Add New -> Import Files`.

![Add New
Material](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/resources_import_files.gif)

Navigate to the material file from your previous project and select it.

Select `Open`.

You should see the selected Material in your `Resources` panel.

## Material Types

There are a number of default Material types built into Lens Studio.

### Diffuse

A basic shaded material. It makes use of scene lights to smoothly shade
the mesh, and supports environmental maps as well.

![Diffuse](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_diffuse_sphere.png)

### Lambert

A basic shaded material. It gets shading from lights, but does not
support environment maps.

![Lambert](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_lambert_sphere.png)

### Unlit

A flat, unshaded material. Supports texture but does not use any
lighting information to shade the object.

![Unlit](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_unlit_sphere.png)

### Occluder

This material can be applied to an object to occlude, or mask, other
objects.

![Occluder](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_occluder_sphere.png)

**Note  
**For more information on how to create your own occluder objects, visit
the [Occluder](/guides/3d/occluders) guide.

### Matte Shadow

This material is applied to objects that receive shadows, and render
only as the received shadow. This is useful when you would like to
ground other objects in your scene, adding an extra level of realism.

![Occluder](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_matte_shadow_sphere.png)

**Note**  
For more information on how to cast and receive shadows in a Lens, visit
the [Light and Shadow](/guides/3d/light-and-shadow) guide.

### PBR

![Occluder](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/Guides/img/material_pbr_sphere.png)

This is a physically based rendering material that simulates the way
light works in the real world.

**Note  
**To read more about how to set up PBR materials in Lens Studio, please
visit the [Substance
Texturing](/guides/3d/texturing/substance-texturing) guide.

## Default Material Properties

The following breakdown provides information on the properties shared by
Lens Studio's materials.

#### Depth Test

Enables depth-sorting.

#### Depth Write

Enables writing to the depth buffer.

#### Depth Function

The comparison method used to sort the depth buffer. Defaults to
LessEqual.

#### Two-sided

Whether the material renders on both sides of a mesh face.

#### Color Write

Enables writing pixels to the frame.

#### Cull Mode

Whether the material culls front or back faces.

#### Blend Mode

The material's blend mode. Available options:

  - Normal
  - Multiply
  - Add
  - Screen
  - Premultiplied Alpha
  - Alpha To Coverage
  - Disabled
  - Add With Alpha Factor
  - Alpha Test
  - Colored Glass

#### Polygon Offset

Changes the position that each polygon gets drawn.

#### Vertex Color

Specifies the purpose for which vertex color will be used. Requires
vertex color to be supplied by the mesh.

#### Base Color

Specifies the base color (albedo) of the material if the base texture is
disabled. Multiplied with the base texture otherwise.

|                 |                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Texture**     | The texture used as a color (albedo) source.****     |
| **Base Tex UV** | Specifies the UV set used for sampling this texture. |

####   
Opacity Texture

Enables use of a separate texture as the alpha source for blending. If
disabled, the Base Color's alpha channel is used for opacity.

|                    |                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Texture**        | The texture used as an opacity source.               |
| **Opacity Tex UV** | Specifies the UV set used for sampling this texture. |

###   
Normal Map

Enables the normal map texture and normal mapping.

|                   |                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Texture**       | The texture used as a normal source.                 |
| **Normal Tex UV** | Specifies the UV set used for sampling this texture. |

####   
Emissive

Enables the emissive texture.

|                        |                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Texture**            | The texture used as an emissive color source.        |
| **Emissive Tex UV**    | Specifies the UV set used for sampling this texture. |
| **Emissive Color**     | The color of the emissive.                           |
| **Emissive Intensity** | Multiplies the existing emissive color.              |

####   
Simple Reflection

Replaces the default PBR environment mapping with a simple lookup from a
regular texture (no hdr, no roughness, no fresnel, etc.). It can even be
used with unlit materials. The reflection lookup technically assumes a
spherical environment map, which is a circular shaped texture.

|               |                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Intensity** | The strength of the reflection effect.  |
| **Texture**   | The texture to use as a reflection map. |

###   
Rim Highlight

Enables rim highlighting, aka Fresnel.

|               |                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color**     | Specifies the color of the rim highlight.                        |
| **Intensity** | Factor multiplied with Color.                                    |
| **Exponent**  | Controls the tightness of the rim highlight.                     |
| **Texture**   | Allows the use of a texture to modulate the rim highlight color. |

###   
Lighting

Enables direct and indirect (ambient) lighting. Disabling this creates
an unlit (flat) shader.

|                       |                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Diffuse Lighting**  | Enables direct and indirect diffuse lighting. Can be disabled as an optimization on pure metals. |
| **Specular Lighting** | Enables direct and indirect specular lighting.                                                   |

| **Envmap**            | Enables an environment map for indirect diffuse and indirect specular lighting.                  |
| **Exposure**          | Changes the brightness of the environment.                                                       |
| **Rotation**          | Rotates the environment relative to world space.                                                 |

####   
Tone Mapping

Enables HDR tone mapping.

#### Fizzle

A noise effect used to mask out the object.

|                |                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Transition** | The strength of the Fizzle effect. |

###   
UV Transforms

Enables tiling and animation of texture coordinates.

## Vertex Color Material

If your model has vertex color information that you'd like to use as the
base color of its material, you can create a custom material that does
so in a few steps.

Create a new Unlit Material.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/snapchat-lens-assets/f1a09194-f02d-43ed-92b8-62e843179ff0/lensStudio/resources_create_material_unlit.gif)

On the new Material, disable the `Base Texture` property.
